# Tennis Datawarehouse

The objective of this project is to create a Datawarehouse from data extracted from the Sportsradar API, in order to eventually develop machine learning models that predict the outcome of matches and tournaments.

Currently, part of the ETL process has been developed to extract the data from the API, apply transformations and load it to a PostgreSQL database.
